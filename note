        Sunday's Kit Description (Version 2.7)
        > Sunday’s base speed is very low.

        > Sunday's Skill grants action advance to a character and their summoned unit. When the target receiving the Skill takes action, Sunday will also gain action priority.

        > Sunday's Ultimate can recharge a teammate's energy and convert excess energy into additional energy.

        > Sunday's support abilities scale with his Attack stat. These abilities may include buffs like damage increase, Attack increase, and Critical Damage increase.

        > Sunday's Technique allows him to use his Skill right after entering battle (the specific mechanism is unclear but is speculated to be related to team positioning).

        > Sunday’s Eidolon 1 and Eidolon 2 are compatible with most characters, possibly increasing penetration and reducing defense while enhancing energy regeneration efficiency.

        > Eidolon 4 and Eidolon 6 might only work well with characters that have summoned units.

        > Eidolon 6 can "copy" a summoned unit. The specific mechanism is that when Sunday uses his Skill to give action advance to a target, the target's summoned unit will act immediately.

        The "copied" summon will disappear after taking action, while the original summon’s action order remains unaffected.
